# Cookie Banner

Cookie Banner is a super-easy way to ensure you're complying with the EU
cookie law. Just reference the `cookiebanner.min.js` script from your page
and you're done.

Cookie Banner script is very lightweight and depends on no JavaScript
libraries, css files or images.

## Demo

To see the script in action, visit the [Good Code web page](http://goodcode.io/).

## Quickstart

Add a single line to your web page, just before the closing `</body>` tag:

    <script type="text/javascript" id="cookiebanner"
        src="http://cookiebanner.eu/js/cookiebanner.min.js"></script>

This will display a black-and-white floating banner at the bottom of your
web page, informing the user that the site is using cookies, and giving them
the link to a page with more information.

When the user clicks the "close" button, the banner will set a cookie
(oh, the irony!) remembering that the banner was acknowledged, so the same
user will not be bothered again.

## Options

If you don't like the defaults, you can modify the banner content and
style. The following options are settable through a `data-` property on the
`script` tag:

* `height` - banner height (default: 32 pixels)
* `fg` - banner text color (default: `#ddd`)
* `bg` - banner background color (default: `#000`)
* `link` - link text color (default: `#aaa`)
* `position` - banner position, `top` or `bottom` (default: `bottom`)
* `message` - the message text
* `linkmsg` - the link text content (default: `Learn more`)
* `effect` - effect to use

* `cookie` - name for the cookie to store the cookiebanner acceptance
  information (default: `cookiebanner-accepted`)
* `moreinfo` - where the visitor can read more about cookies
  (default: [http://aboutcookies.org](http://aboutcookies.org))

* `mask` - whether to create a mask over the viewport (default: `false`). Clicking anywhere on the mask is considered as acceptance.
* `mask-opacity` - the opacity to use for the window mask (default: `0.5`)
* `mask-background` - optional background style you wish to apply to the `mask` <div> (default: `#000`)

* `zindex` - z-index to set on the notice (default: `255`). If `mask` is used, the notice <div>'s z-index is automatically incremented by 1 so it appears above the mask)

Here's an example:

    <script type="text/javascript" id="cookiebanner"
        src="//cookiebanner.eu/js/cookiebanner.js"
        data-height="20px" data-position="top"
        data-message="We use cookies to improve your browsing experience.">
    </script>

## Self-hosting

If you don't want to depend on the `cookiebanner.eu` site, you can copy
the `cookiebanner.min.js` directly to your site.

If you're using SSL, you'll also need to host the file yourself, as Amazon S3
service that we're using for hosting doesn't support adding custom SSL
certificates.

## Internals and more options

If the banner needs to be shown, the script will create the following DOM
subtree and add it just before the closing `</body>` tag:

    <div class="cookiebanner">
        <div style="float: right; padding-left:5px;">x</div>
        <span>Message</span>
        <a href=".." target="_blank">Learn more</a>        
    </div>

You can use CSS with `div.cookiebanner > span` and `div.cookiebanner > a` to
further modify the banner appearance.

## Hacking

Get the newest and the freshest from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/dobarkod/cookie-banner.git

If you've modified the code, it's recommended you run it through linter
to catch potential errors, and minifier to minimize its footprint.

We're old-school here so we just use Makefile for the tasks:

    make check  # run jshint to check the code
    make # minify it

You'll need `jshint` and `uglifyjs` tools installed for this.

Pull requests are welcome! In order to get your pull-request accepted,
please follow these simple rules:

* all code submissions must pass cleanly (no errors) with `make check`
* there should be no external JavaScript, CSS, image files or any other
  dependencies
* the code should work with no errors or warnings on recent Chrome, Firefox,
  Safari, Internet Explorer browsers and iOS and Android platforms
* if you want to add significant features, file an issue about it first so
  we can discuss whether the addition makes sense for the project
